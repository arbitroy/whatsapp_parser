24/07/24, 9:28 pm - Jan Willem van Casteren: Re surveys, please note that surveys should not have 500 questions. It will take hours to fill in this information,  farmers will give poor answers that are useless and they will never be available anymore for surveys in the future. It is a risk for company sustainability! That defeats any purpose, so @254707538420 please, let's find out which clients use these long surveys and we plan to break them into smaller surveys
